# backend/app/routes -- HTTP / SSE endpoints

One job: thin FastAPI handlers that validate input and delegate to the agent/services.

## What's here
- `health.py` -- `GET/HEAD /health` + `GET /providers` (the model catalog).
- `research.py` -- `POST /research/stream`: the research pipeline as SSE.
- `chat.py` -- `POST /chat/stream` (the agent turn, SSE) + read-only `GET /memory`
  and `GET /trace` for the dashboard.
- `__init__.py`

## Reads / Writes
- Reads: `../models/` (requests), `../agent/loop.run_turn`, `../providers/base`,
  `../services/research`, `../memory/store`.
- Writes: HTTP responses (JSON or SSE). No persistence here (memory writes happen
  inside the turn loop).

## Rules
- Handlers stay thin -- turn logic in `../agent/`, research logic in `../services/`.
- Pydantic rejects bad input as 422 before streaming; in-stream failures become a
  single SSE `error` event, never a 500 mid-stream.
- A new router module must be registered in `../main.py` (`include_router`).
